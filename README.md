# San-Andreas-AI
In this project you can see many files and might be confused for what to do ....... just take a deep breathe and follow what I say!!!
1. Download and store all the files in a single directory.
2. Cut and paste the dll file in it to your san andreas game folder
3. Now set the resolution to 640*480
4. Train, Test and enjoy
Report issues if found
